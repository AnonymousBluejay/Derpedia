#### Notes
Items are naturally unbreakable and hides the unbreakable tag.


#### ItemName
Every item must have an ItemName. ItemName can consist of any uppercase and lowercase letter, number, and underscore. No space bars allowed. Keep in mind each item must have a unique name. This is also the item ID used in game. Defaults to the item name of Type.

#### Type
Type can be any minecraft item ID, this is the item that will appear in game. Defaults to "iron_horse_armor".

#### CustomModelData
Model ID of the item. The ID list will be released at a later date. 

#### Slot
The slot is very important, it changes the way the item constructor creates items. Defaults to item.

Slots currently include: <br />
**rig** - placed in rig slot in loadout <br />
**core** - placed in core slot in loadout <br />
**mod** - placed in mod slots in loadout <br />
**armor** - cosmetic armor with no stats <br />
**weapon** - enables player interact event checks, weapons are still a work in progress <br />
**item** - normal item, nothing special <br />
**placeholder** - disabled for items <br />
**immobile** - disabled for items <br />

#### Description
Descriptions are automatically formatted and added to the lore, there are no need for new lines.

#### Color
Color is used for leather armor only, and should be entered in RGB format. <br />
Example: Color: 85,255,255

#### Attributes
**max_health** - increase the maximum health of the player by the specified amount <br />
**movement_speed** - increase the movement speed of the player by the specified amount <br />
movement_speed is counted in blocks per second, a value of 1 means the player walks 1 blocks per second faster than normal <br />
**stability** - decrease the velocity of knockback taken by the player <br />
stability is a percentage value, a value of 0.2 means the player takes 20% less knockback <br />

#### Core
**mod_capacity** - increase number of mods a loadout can hold (up to a maximum of 16) <br />
**energy_output** - increase the maximum amount of power that can be used by mods <br />
**energy_usage** - how much power is used up by the mod <br />

#### Defenses
Defenses has 6 sub-categories for the 6 elemental damages, each reduce the damage taken from that element by a percentage <br />
Example: "impact: 10.5" would mean whoever uses the item take 10.5% impact damage <br />

#### Resistances
Resistances also has 6 sub-categories, each increase the threshold of procs before a status effect activates. A player with no gear has 100 in every category by default, further values increase or decrease that value. <br />
Example: "fire: 50" would mean an extra 50 points of fire proc can be absorbed before a player is set on fire <br />
NOTE: Procs decrease at a percentage rate, meaning higher resistance will make procs wear off faster before it triggers. After a proc triggers, it goes down at a fixed rate. <br />

#### Damages
Damages also has 6 sub-categories, each boosting the damage done by the player of that category by a percentage <br />
Example: "slash: 20" means the player deals 20% more slash damage <br />

#### Energy
**energy_max** - Increases the maximum energy capacity of the player <br />
**energy_regen_amount** - amount of energy regained for each tick of energy regen <br />
**energy_regen_rate** - delay in ticks between each energy regen tick <br />
A value of 10 would mean a player regains energy_regen_amount of energy every 10 ticks (0.5s) <br />
Higher value means slower regen, lower value means faster regen <br />
This value can change a player's energy regain rate drastically <br />
**energy_regen_delay** - delay in ticks before a player starts regaining energy again after using up some energy (for abilities) <br />
**energy_efficiency** - percentage reduction in energy used <br />
A value of 10 would mean the player uses 10% less energy when using abilities <br />
