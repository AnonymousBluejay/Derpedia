# Derpedia - Player
Players should familiarize themselves with this section of the wiki. Admins and developers should also have a good grasp of all the mechanics listed here.



### User Commands
/loadout - Open loadout GUI
/stats - Show your detailed stats

## Loadout
You might find it odd to see very few players with armor, that's because they are purely cosmetic. The beneficial stats of armor are locked behind the Loadout system. /loadout is used to open the loadout menu, where you can equip and customize your gear.

### The basics
The loadout consists of three components, the Rig, the Core, and the Mods. The Rig and Core are required to activate your loadout, with the Rig providing basic stats and mod slots, and the Core providing energy related stats. Mods allow for a further degree of customization. Each mod takes up a mod slot, and some core energy, and modifies your stats in many ways.

### Mods
Mods must be placed in order from 1 to 16 to function. Mods placed outside of the order or above the capacity/power will not affects the loadout, meaning you can use the remaining slots as mod storage.

### Abilities
There are three types of abilities, Shift, Jump, and Passive. Abilities can have multiple levels that improve or modify their functionalities. Some rigs and power cores come with abilities, some mods also add, replace, or upgrade abilities.

#### Shift Abilities
Shift abilities are triggered by holding down or releasing shift (sneak). Most are either active while sneaking or charged while sneaking.

**Charged Boost**
Charged ability, charge begins on shift. Charge up a powerful boost in the direction of the crosshair, can be used on ground and mid air. The longer it's charged, the stronger the boost. If an elytra is equipped, will automatically enter the gliding state when charge is released. Level 2 and above of this ability are able to stop momentum and float mid air while charging.
Base Cost: 40
Charge Cost: 20/second

**Jetpack**
Hold ability, grants constant momentum while holding. Boost you in the direction of the crosshair while holding down shift. If an elytra is equipped, will automatically enter the gliding state. The boost starts small and increase to a certain extent the longer shift is held down. Higher levels decrease the time needed to reach maximum speed.
Energy Cost: 20/second

**Equilibrium**
Hold ability, converts health to energy, and vise versa. Converts a bit of your health or energy to the other, whichever one is lower in percentage.
Conversion Rate: 2 + (2*level) /second

#### Jump Abilities
Jump abilities are activated by double clicking jump while in the air, the same way you would activate flying in creative mode.

**Air Jump**
Allows you to jump again mid air with higher velocity, an extra boost is provided in the direction of the crosshair. The higher the level, the more jumps you can do before landing.
Energy Cost: 10

**Air Dash**
Quickly dash in a straight line in the direction of the crosshair, velocity is stopped when the dash ends. Only one dash can be performed per landing. The higher the level, the longer the dash.
Energy Cost: 5 + (5*level) /second

#### Passive abilities
Passive abilities are 

**Shock Absorber**
Activated by fall damage or crash landing elytra. Consumes energy to prevent or reduce fall damage.
Reduction: 1 energy/damage

**Waterproof**

## Stats
The stats in this game are more complex than vanilla Minecraft, and can take some getting used to.

#### Health
It's essentially the same, you might find the numbers higher than normal.

#### Energy
Energy is required to use abilities, and when used, will start recharging after a short cooldown

#### Status Effects
Certain damage sources deal status effect damage, which will gradually fill up status effect bars on the top of the screen. Status effect damage will decay over time, but when filled will trigger a special effect.

**Heat**
